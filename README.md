# Bash_Searcher_c_plus_plus
This application will search through all of your bash history files to find terminal commands you've typed before. The searcher saves the results to a set, to remove any duplicates, then outputs those findings to your terminal, where you can then copy and paste them.

This app works with MacOSX, this should find all previous commands you've ever entered into your terminal. This differs from doing a history grep, because it traverses all previous bash history files.
